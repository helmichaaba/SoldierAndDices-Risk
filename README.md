## Project Description
The project on which we are working is a class project on which we have to code a game using Python, in order to evaluate our understanding. 
The game was chosen by chance, it is about soldiers and dices.

## Rules
To play the game, 2 persons are needed, each player has 6 dices. 

To start the game, each player has to put one of the six dices in the middle of the table. The youngest player goes first. On a playerâ€™s turn, that player rolls their remaining dice (five at the start of the game). After the roll, you must select one or two of your rolled dice to score, setting them aside for the end of the round. You then roll your remaining dice, again setting aside one or two dice to score. You may continue rolling and scoring as long as you have dice left to roll. Once the first player has taken their turn and written down their score, the second player now takes a turn, following the same rules.

Exception of six: if the die rolls a six, that should not be counted to the total, but ads two more rolls. The new rolls should be added to the total, unless one of them is a six, then the re-rolling continues.

Ending the Game: When a player has no dice left to roll, the game automatically ends. The winner is the player with the highest total score (add up the scores from each round).

## Workflow
In order to well manage our project, we started our work on Jira, each person of the group knows his role.
First of all we tried to acquire more knowledge about the game and its rules, then we started by preparing the flowchart to have a better view on what is needed step-by-step.

## Organization
In order to organise our project, we used Jira.
